# Reads a CSV file where the first line is a list of properties

# This function can generalize although for now it assumes that the CSV file contains instances
# of the NGORecpient class. Enhancements: 1) write a function to check that the data property exists
# 2) Find the range of the data property if it exists and coerce the literal into that datatype if the
# data property doesn't exist or the literal can't be coerced signal an error.
